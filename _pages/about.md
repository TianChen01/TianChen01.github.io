Welcome! My name is Tian Chen. I am a third-year PhD student in Political Science at Washington University, with research interests in comparative and historical political economy. My current projects focus on the interplay between political dynamics and technological change, employing causal inference, survey and experimental methods. My research is funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York.
